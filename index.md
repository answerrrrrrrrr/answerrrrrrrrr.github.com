Hello, there.

This is the first time I have a blog.

Unfortunately, I haven't even figured out what to write about, which reminds me of one of my favorite 

Song Lyrics:
	
				少年不识愁滋味
				爱上层楼
				爱上层楼
				为赋新词强说愁
			
				而今识尽愁滋味
				欲说还休
				欲说还休
				却道天凉好个秋

Hope not to be like that...

Now that this is my home page, let me just write something about myself:

        def __init__(self):
            self.id = Air9
            self.age = 
            self.name = 
            self.major =
